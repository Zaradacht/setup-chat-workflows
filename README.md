# setup-chat-workflows

OpenCode plugin that adds workflow-aware chatbot commands for a structured way of working. It ships generic starter examples for:

- `general`
- `pr-review`
- `new-task`

but these are only defaults. Teams can create any number of workflows such as `incident`, `release`, `design-review`, `support`, or anything else.

The plugin installs:

- `/setup-chat-workflows` — walks the user through configuring the project's workflow tree.
- `/new-session` — chooses or infers a workflow, asks only that workflow's required subset of questions, and starts only after the required intake is satisfied or explicitly skipped.

## Human TL;DR

1. Install the plugin.
2. Restart OpenCode.
3. Run `/setup-chat-workflows` once.
4. Choose what to set up: project defaults, workflows, post-intake actions, or all of them.
5. Restart OpenCode.
6. Use `/new-session <what you want to do>`.

`/new-session` will pick the right workflow, ask only the questions needed for that workflow, show a brief, and start after you confirm.

Post-intake actions are optional follow-ups for the selected workflow only. Example: `new-task` can suggest a planning command after confirmation, while `general` can have no action.

## Agent TL;DR

- `/setup-chat-workflows` owns configuration. It creates or updates `.opencode/workflow-intake/project.md`, `workflows.md`, and `actions.md`.
- Always ask what the user wants to edit first: full setup, project defaults only, workflow definitions only, post-intake actions only, or review current setup.
- `/new-session` owns runtime intake. It reads the configured workflow tree, selects or infers one workflow, asks exactly one compact intake form for that workflow, renders a brief, and waits for confirmation.
- Do not ask a second follow-up form. Compact required structured questions, required text fields, optional context, and gates into the single initial form. If a tool cannot capture text fields, present one fillable form in one assistant message and wait for one reply.
- Post-intake actions are scoped to the selected workflow. Apply the default action policy plus the matching `## <workflow-name>` section only. Never run all actions globally.
- Do not run post-intake actions before the user confirms the workflow brief.

## Core lineage

```text
.opencode/workflow-intake/project.md
.opencode/workflow-intake/workflows.md
.opencode/workflow-intake/actions.md
  -> injected into /setup-chat-workflows as editable setup parts
  -> used to generate /new-session workflow intake
```

OpenCode loads plugins at startup, so after `/setup-chat-workflows` writes a new config, restart OpenCode to regenerate `/new-session` from the updated workflow tree.

## Why

Most coding sessions are not the same. A general question should not require PR-review metadata. A PR review should require a PR link and source task/card context. A new task should require a goal, milestones, and approval/review gates.

This plugin lets a project define the required intake subset per workflow. The workflow list is plug-and-play: edit `workflows.md` to add, remove, or rename workflows.

## Quickstart

Install in `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["setup-chat-workflows"]
}
```

For local development:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["file:///absolute/path/to/setup-chat-workflows"]
}
```

Restart OpenCode, then run:

```text
/setup-chat-workflows
```

That creates:

```text
.opencode/workflow-intake/project.md
.opencode/workflow-intake/workflows.md
.opencode/workflow-intake/actions.md
```

Restart OpenCode again, then start work with:

```text
/new-session Review https://github.com/acme/app/pull/123
```

or:

```text
/new-session Implement the Trello card https://trello.com/c/abc123
```

```

The example files included in this package define `general`, `pr-review`, and `new-task`, but the plugin itself does not require those names.

## What `/setup-chat-workflows` asks

It uses chatbot-style prompting, not a custom UI.

It should first ask what you want to create or update:

- full setup: project defaults + workflows + post-intake actions
- project defaults only
- workflow definitions only
- post-intake actions only
- review current setup without writing

### 1. One setup form

It asks one compact setup form. The first field is what you want to create or update:

- full setup: project defaults + workflows + post-intake actions
- project defaults only
- workflow definitions only
- post-intake actions only
- review current setup without writing

The same form includes fields such as:

- project source systems
- issue tracker relationship
- external update default
- default language
- starter workflow set: blank/custom, general+pr-review+new-task, incident/release, other
- default start gate
- post-intake action policy
- project label
- default source systems / source URL guidance
- default issue tracker project names or IDs
- external update destination and tone
- workflow names and required fields
- post-intake actions or skill calls by workflow
- approval / merge / completion rules
- external posting and branch/policy bypass rules

### 2. Rendered proposed markdown

It renders the proposed three files so the user can inspect them:

```text
.opencode/workflow-intake/project.md
.opencode/workflow-intake/workflows.md
.opencode/workflow-intake/actions.md
```

### 3. Confirmation before writing

It asks:

```text
Write this workflow intake config?
- Write config
- Edit fields
- Cancel
```

It writes only after confirmation.

## If no config exists

No existing config is required.

If one or more workflow-intake files do not exist, `/setup-chat-workflows` treats the missing files as first-run setup and walks the user through creating them from scratch.

Requirements:

- OpenCode must allow `question`.
- OpenCode must allow file read/write/edit.
- The project directory, or at least `.opencode/`, must be writable.
- No external API keys or services are required.

## What `/new-session` asks

`/new-session` first chooses or infers workflow type from `.opencode/workflow-intake/workflows.md`.

It should ask exactly one compact intake form for the selected workflow. It should not ask a second follow-up form. Required text fields, optional notes, and gate choices should be compacted into the initial form.

The package examples include these starter workflows:

### general

- no required subset by default
- can start after brief confirmation

### pr-review

Asks the minimal PR-review-specific required subset:

- PR URL
- source task/card link
- source system
- target branch
- PR scope, such as full PR, PBI only, Dataform only, recipient alignment only, notification/email behavior only, pipeline dependency only, docs/config only, or other
- review depth/pass
- merge expectation
- external update expectation

Optional context such as review focus, known risks, validation notes, and open notes should not trigger a second prompt unless the workflow explicitly marks those fields as required.

### new-task

Asks new-task-specific subset:

- source task/card link
- source system
- goal
- milestones to confirm
- implementation expectation
- plan approval gate
- review depth/pass
- completion/merge gate
- validation expectations

You can add more workflows by adding more `## <workflow-name>` sections to `workflows.md` and matching action sections in `actions.md`.

## Post-intake actions / skills

Each workflow can define post-intake actions: optional next steps that `/new-session` runs or suggests only after the user confirms the workflow brief.

They are not setup-time actions. They are workflow-specific handoffs such as:

- for `new-task`: suggest or run a planning command after intake confirmation
- for `pr-review`: suggest a review command, checklist, or reviewer skill after intake confirmation
- for `incident`: suggest an incident-debugging checklist after intake confirmation
- for `general`: no action

Examples:

```markdown
- post-intake action policy: run after confirmation
- post-intake actions / skills: /your-planning-command after intake confirmation
```

Rules:

- `/new-session` includes these actions in the rendered workflow brief.
- It does not run them before confirmation.
- If policy is `suggest only`, it asks whether to run them.
- If policy is `run after confirmation`, it runs them only after the user selects `Confirm and start`.

### Example: planning action for new-task

For a project that should suggest a planning command for new tasks:

```markdown
### new-task

- enabled: true
- required structured questions: source task/card link; source system; implementation expectation; plan approval gate; review depth/pass; completion/merge gate; external update expectation
- required input fields: goal; milestones to confirm; scope boundaries; validation expectations; open notes
- default review depth/pass: strong/4-pass for risky work
- start gate: do not start implementation until goal, milestones, and gates are answered or explicitly marked unknown/skip by the user
- post-intake actions / skills: /your-planning-command after intake confirmation
```
